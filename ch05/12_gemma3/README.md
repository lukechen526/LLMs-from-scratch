# Gemma 3 270M From Scratch

This [standalone-gemma3.ipynb](standalone-gemma3.ipynb) Jupyter notebook in this folder contains a from-scratch implementation of Gemma 3 270M. It requires about 2 GB of RAM to run.

Below is a side-by-side comparison with Qwen3 0.6B as a reference model; if you are interested in the Qwen3 0.6B standalone notebook, you can find it [here](../11_qwen3).
